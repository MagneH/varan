## Installation

<a id="installation-global"></a>
### Global installation

It is possible to install `varan` globally and initiate new projects similar to [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is very useful for creating new projects, but keep in mind that it is highly recommended to use a local project installation of `varan` after creating a new project.

1. Install `varan` globally

```bash
$ npm i -g varan
```

2. Create a new project

```bash
$ varan init my-varan-app
```

Optionally use the [advanced](https://github.com/ersims/varan-boilerplate/tree/master) project template/boilerplate by specifying `--advanced`:

```bash
$ varan init --advanced my-varan-app
```

<a id="installation-local"></a>
### Local installation for existing projects

1. Install `varan` in your project

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev varan
```

2. Add npm scripts in your `package.json` to support your workflow. This is usually enough for most projects:

```bash
  "scripts": {
    "build": "varan build",
    "build:analyze": "varan build --analyze",
    "watch": "varan watch -- --inspect"
  }
```

3. Optionally customize the webpack config to support your specific project.

At a minimum, make sure your entry files are explicitly defined in your own custom config, or matches the defaults of varan. See [customization](#customization) for more information.

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage

```bash
$ varan

  Usage:  <command> [options]
  
  Options:

    -V, --version               output the version number
    -h, --help                  output usage information

  Commands:

    init [options] <name>
    build [options] [files...]
    watch [options]

```

<a id="usage-development"></a>
### Development (using local installation and npm scripts)
Start the development server with hot reloading by running
```bash
npm run watch
```

<a id="usage-production"></a>
### Production (using local installation and npm scripts)
To create a minified and bundled production build, run
```bash
npm run build
```

To analyze the production build, run
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```

<a id="customization"></a>
## Customization

Varan provides sane defaults and should be a good starting point for most projects. You can find the default [client](/webpack/client.js) and [server](/webpack/server.js) config files under `varan/webpack`. 

The most important option to set correctly is the entry points. Existing projects implementing varan might have to set a custom entry point for the client and/or the server using a [custom webpack config](#customization-webpack). 
The default entry points in varan are as follows:

| Type   | Entry file relative to project root |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Client | `src/client/index`                  |
| Server | `src/server/bin/web`                |

<a id="customization-polyfill"></a>
### Polyfills and browser support

Varan automatically adds basic polyfills for IE11 (to be removed at some point) and injects any other necessary polyfills using [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env.html) and [@babel/plugin-transform-runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime.html) based on your [browserslist](#browserslist).
Note that it is expected that you have `@babel/runtime` and either `core-js` or `@babel/runtime-corejs2` package as a production dependency to provide polyfills.

<a id="customization-browserslist"></a>
### Browserslist

Varan supports [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for polyfilling. Refer to [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) for more information on how to use it. Varan supports both `.browserslistrc` files and the `browserslist` property in `package.json`.

<a id="customization-webpack"></a>
### Custom webpack config

Customizations are supported through specifying your own webpack config files for `varan build` and/or `varan watch`.
It is recommended to create your own `webpack` directory with your client and server files, and specifying these when using `varan build` and `varan watch`.

#### Example

Create the following directory structure in the root of your project
```bash
my-project
\--- webpack
     +--- client.js - client customizations
     \--- server.js - server customizations
```

Make sure the `client.js` and `server.js` files exports a function that returns the webpack configuration object.

`server.js` with no modifications:
```javascript
module.exports = require('varan/webpack/server');
```

`client.js` with a Progressive Web App manifest while still using the default config in `varan`:
```javascript
// Dependencies
const path = require('path');
const client = require('varan/webpack/client');
const pwaManifest = {
  name: 'Varan Progressive Web App!!!',
  short_name: 'VaranPWA',
  description: 'My awesome Progressive Web App using Varan!',
  background_color: '#ffffff',
  theme_color: '#ffffff',
  icons: [
    {
      src: path.resolve(__dirname, '../src/assets/favicon.ico'),
      sizes: [96, 192, 512],
    },
  ],
};

// Exports
module.exports = options => client({ ...options, pwaManifest });
```

Note that development mode only supports up to two config files, one with `target: 'browser'` and one with  `target: 'node'`
To use your new files in development mode, run:
```bash
varan watch ./webpack/client ./webpack/server
```

For production build you can specify a list of config files to build like so:
```bash
varan build ./webpack/client ./webpack/server
```

Remember to update your npm scripts to use the new config files as shown above.

<a id="dependency-errors"></a>
### Syntax errors in dependencies

Sometimes you may encounter dependencies that require special care or a custom webpack config.
This is usually because the dependency is built for a different environment than you have, either it is browser vs Node.js or different version of Node.js.

Typically you will see something similar when running your application:

```bash
ðŸ’¬ SERVER: [REDACTED]/node_modules/@aws-amplify/ui/dist/style.css:13
:root {
^

SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
    at new Script (vm.js:79:7)
    at createScript (vm.js:251:10)
    at Object.runInThisContext (vm.js:303:10)
    at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:657:28)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:700:10)
    at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:599:32)
    at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:538:12)
    at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:530:3)
    at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:637:17)
    at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:20:18)
```

In this case it is because `aws-amplify` and `aws-amplify-react` is installed and depends on `@aws-amplify/ui` which requires a `.css` file.
This works fine in the front-end because all code, including `node_modules`, is bundled and run through webpack.
The back-end Node.js server does not run `node_modules` through webpack and hence does not know how to parse `.css` files.
The result is that the crashes immediately when started.

This specific issue can be solved in two ways;

1. Bundle the specific dependency that causes issues. This is the recommended approach.
2. Bundle all `node_modules` - even on the server. Note that this may have severe performance implications.

In both cases you will need to create your own webpack configuration and override the relevant options.
See [customizing webpack](#customization-webpack) for more information on using your own webpack config.

This is an example of a custom webpack config for solving the specific issue described above according to the recommended option 1):

```javascript
const server = require('varan/webpack/server');

module.exports = options => server({ whitelistExternals: ['aws-amplify-react'] });
```
